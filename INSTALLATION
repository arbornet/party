Installation of the party program version 2.13:

1.  Create user account or group for party to run as.

    Party can either be a set-user-id (suid) or set-group-id (sgid) program.
    The suid option is generally to be prefered.

    The suid option has the advantage of making it possible to have "keeplog"
    channels permitted only to certain groups by playing with the group
    permissions of the log file.  Note that with sgid, volatile channels
    will be created with files owned by the user.  This allows the user to
    play with the permissions which may or may not be considered desirable.

    If possible, a new account or group should be created for party to run
    in.  If not, an existing account or group can be used.

2.  Run ./configure

    The following options are interesting:

     --with-suid=<login>
     --with-sgid=<group>

            Only one of these options should be set.  If you want party to
	    Run suid, name the login on the --suid option.  If you want party
	    to run sgid, name the group on the --sgid option.

            If neither option is given, the default is --suid=party

     --prefix=<dir>
     --exec-prefix=<dir>

	    Main installation directory.  Prefix defaults to /usr/local, and
	    exec-prefix defaults to prefix.

     --bindir=<dir>

	    Where executable is installed.  Default is <exec-prefix>/bin

     --sysconfdir=<dir>

	    Most party config files live in the <sysconfdir>/party/ directory.
	    Default is <prefix>/etc.

     --localstatedir=<dir>

	    Party log files are kept in <localstatedir>/party.   Default is
	    <prefix>/var.

     --mandir=<dir>

	    The party manual page will be installed in <mandir>/man1.
	    Default is <prefix>/man.

     --disable-close

	    Disable the feature that allows users to close channels, so that
	    only the users already in the channel and those invited to the
	    channel may join.  This works best with suid party.  If you set
	    it up with sgid, closed channels are still readable to other
	    users.

     --disable-ignore

            Disable the feature that allows users to maintain a list of
	    users who's remarks they do not wish to see.
        
2.  Compile with a "make" command.

3.  If you are doing an upgrade, it is probably not a good idea to do a
    'make install', as this will overwrite all your configuration files.
    Instead, just copy the binary to the same place as the old one, permitting
    it suid or sgid the appropriate user or group.  You might also install
    the manual page.

     For an initial installation, run 'make install' as 'root' (or as
     whatever user you are running suid as, if that user has write access to
     all the relavant directories).

    This will install the binary in <bindir> and set it suid or sgid, as
    configured (changing the permission setup requires recompilation, or
    log files will be created with inappropriate permissions).  A link
    name 'pwho' is created.  This command will list the users currently
    in party.  A log directory will be created and default configuration files
    will be installed.

4.  If you want to have multiple entries to party with different default
    options, or starting in different channels, or in whole different
    universes of channels, make a link to the party binary for each program
    and add a line to the party tab starting with the link name and listing
    all the options you like.  This file must be readable by party.

5.  Edit the chantab file (whose path name is given by the "chantab" option
    which may be either compiled in or set in the partytab file).  Each line
    of the starts with the name of a channel, and is followed by a list
    of options for that channel.  You don't need to specify any options,
    but having different options in different channels is more fun.  You
    can use wildcard characters (* and ? and [..]) in the channel names.
    Users may use any channel whose name matches any pattern in the chantab.

    Channels whose names don't have wildcards in them will be listed by
    the ":list" command even if nobody is in them.  It is probably a good
    idea to put the keeplog option only on these channels.  Normally the
    last line of the chantab would just have the pattern "*", so that users
    can use any channel name.  A sample chantab is included in the
    distribution.

6.  Put something in the crontab to restart each channel with the "keeplog"
    option regularly.  This consists simply of removing the log files (or
    mv'ing them to a backup place).  You don't need to create new files unless
    you want them to have strange permissions.  Party will do that as needed.

    Note that if you don't give any channels the "keeplog" option, the you
    don't have to bother with this.

    Log files for channels with "nokeeplog" set are supposed to be removed
    when the last person leaves the channel.  This mechanism is not completely
    reliable, mainly because people can "kill -9" their party processes,
    which causes them to exit without giving party a chance to clean up after
    them.  So you may find some "name.tmp" files in the log directory long
    after everyone has left that channel.  Usually joining that channel and
    leaving will cause it to be cleaned up.  But it would probably be a good
    idea to include some command like 

	    find <party-log-dir> -name \*.tmp -ctime +2 -exec rm -f {} \;

    in the cron's daily script to eliminate "nokeeplog" log files more than
    two days old.
